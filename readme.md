# Training Project - Game of Life

I came up a little with humor, in the game, instead of cellular organisms,
the popular languages Python and Java compete :) Of the concepts proposed by
the trainers, I replaced the cascade of "if"-s with a dictionary method.
I also added a display of the generations counter to the page tab in place
of the title.
