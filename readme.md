# Training Project - Game of Life

This project is developed on the framework Flask

I came up a little with humor, in the game, instead of cellular organisms,
the popular languages Python and Java compete :) Of the concepts proposed by
the trainers, I replaced the cascade of "if"-s with a dictionary method.
I also added a display of the generations counter to the page tab in place
of the title.

This also resolved the issue of displaying the third state of cells, which
should have been implemented through the metaclass, for clarity, I did not
remove it. I can later return to this implementation as an additional practice.

P.S. Java is a great programming language.
